     public static void main(String[] args) is like the starting point of a Java program. 
     Think of it as the "main door" through which the program starts running. 
     Here’s what each part means:

    public: Anyone can use it; it’s open to everyone.
    static: It belongs to the class itself, so no need to create an object to use it.
    void: It doesn’t give back anything; just does its job and finishes.
    main: The name of the main door. This is the method the program looks for when it starts.
    String[] args: A way to take extra input when the program starts, like tools you bring when you enter.
    So, without main, your Java program doesn’t know where to start!
